## Note

The rules file location may vary depending on the IDE used (VS Code, Cursor, or Claude Code).  
This submission uses **VS Code** conventions.

---

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Setup

- Configured IDE with Tenx MCP server
- Ensured MCP connection was active during agent interactions

---

### Task 2: Research & Configure

- Studied best practices for AI agent rules (including community workflows)
- Iteratively refined the agent rules file
- Tested agent behavior changes through structured prompts
- Guided the agent to scaffold a production-ready Node.js project

---

### Task 3: Documentation

Documented:

- What was done
- What worked
- What didn’t work
- Insights gained about AI agent behavior and collaboration

---

## Key Learnings

- Agent behavior is strongly shaped by explicit rules and constraints
- Clear task boundaries improve AI collaboration
- Iterative feedback significantly improves output quality
- Treating the AI agent as a collaborator (not a tool) leads to better results

---

## Submission Notes

- This repository is **public** as required
- All required artifacts are included
- MCP agent interactions were performed with an active Tenx MCP connection
- Documentation is provided even in cases where tooling limitations may exist

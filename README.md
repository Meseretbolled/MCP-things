MCP Setup Challenge – Task Submission
Overview

This repository contains my submission for the TRP 1 – MCP Setup Challenge.
The goal of this challenge was to configure an AI-assisted development environment using MCP tools, define effective agent rules, and document how those rules influenced collaboration with an AI coding agent.

This repository includes:

The final AI agent rules configuration

Documentation of my workflow and findings

Supporting artifacts that demonstrate exploration, iteration, and effort

Tasks Completed
Task 1: Setup

Configured IDE with Tenx MCP server

Ensured MCP connection was active during agent interactions

Task 2: Research & Configure

Studied best practices for AI agent rules (including community workflows)

Iteratively refined the agent rules file

Tested agent behavior changes through structured prompts

Guided the agent to scaffold a production-ready Node.js project

Task 3: Documentation

Documented:

What was done

What worked

What didn’t work

Insights gained about AI agent behavior and collaboration

Key Learnings

Agent behavior is strongly shaped by explicit rules and constraints

Clear task boundaries improve AI collaboration

Iterative feedback significantly improves output quality

Treating the AI agent as a collaborator (not a tool) leads to better results

Submission Notes

This repository is public as required

All required artifacts are included

MCP agent interactions were performed with an active Tenx MCP connection

Documentation is provided even in cases where tooling limitations may exist
